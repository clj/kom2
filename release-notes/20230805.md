## Don't Panic

* Removed all explicit panics in the driver
* Improve error handling in general
* Fix GetDiagRec
* Enable testing in Windows
    * Sadly not in CI, the installer segfaults when setting up the driver string, but tests can be run locally
* Use pypyodbc for testing instead of pyodbc
* Make loglevel case insensitive
* Add some more logging
* Implement
    * SQLGetDiagField (makes error reporting work in Windows)
    * SQLEndTran (makes pypyodbc not print warnings)
